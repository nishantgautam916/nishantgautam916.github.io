        <h1 class="display-4">A simple article</h1>
        <p class="lead">On working hard.....</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Consider these seven, just to get started:

            1. Work forces personal development.
            
            Work, by its very nature, presents challenges and growth opportunities. It requires us to improve and develop and become better versions of ourselves. The more we grow, the better at work we get… and the greater the challenges become.
            
            2. Our work brings benefit to society.
            
            Our work contributes to the good of society. It serves others, it enriches peoples’ lives, and it moves everyone forward. Whether we are bagging groceries, delivering mail, analyzing stocks, curing cancer, or managing other workers, we can view our work as an act of love to the people we serve.
            
            3. Hard work is an example to our kids.
            
            When we strive to do our best work each day, our kids take notice. And among the greatest character traits I hope to pass on to my children is the importance of working hard on things that matter.
            
            4. Work hard at work to work hard at life.
            
            We learn important life lessons when we give ourselves over to hard work: determination, attentiveness, responsibility, problem-solving, and self-control all come to mind. These lessons, in turn, serve us in other areas (health, relationships, hobbies, etc.).
            
            5. Work hard to make the most of your hours. They will pass anyway.
            
            Each new day brings with it an important choice: either we fill it with our best or we allow it to slip away. There is no other option—the hours are going to pass anyway. Choosing to work hard makes the most of them. Please note: I am not discounting the importance of rest or balance—I have written about both extensively.
            
            6. Work is fulfilling, in and of itself.
            
            In my opinion, there are few joys in life more satisfying than laying down at night with tired legs attached to a tired body. To know I gave my full energy to something important is an amazing feeling and fulfilling in itself.
            
            7. Working hard keeps our lives occupied with important matters.
            
            Living an unoccupied life is a recipe for disaster. Choosing to fill our time and energy with things that bring value to others helps keep us from selfish and foolish decisions with idle time.
